# Identifying-Safe-Loans-With-Binary-Decision-Trees

This project focuses on building a model to predict whether or not a loan provided by a company is likely to default based on the various customer details.It uses binary decision tree for accomplishing this task.Decision tree learning uses a decision tree (as a predictive model) to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves).
